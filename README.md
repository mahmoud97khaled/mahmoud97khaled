- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mahmoud97khaled
I am fresh graduate engineer who has the passion to learn, I have
studied machine learning, deep learning and computer vision from
different resources. (all courses and certificates are attached on LinkedIn
account). I love improving myself every day also I focused on
machine learning as my career and I started to implement many
projects using deep learning technics. My last project was steel defects
detection. and it was my graduation project, we used CNNs to train
and test our program, the main aim of the project is to detect any
external defects in pipelines using camera. the project is on GitHub
attached on my profile.
